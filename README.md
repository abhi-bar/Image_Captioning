Project: Image Captioning with Deep Learning
This repository implements an image captioning model that automatically generates descriptions for unseen images.

Highlights:

Multi-step approach: Feature extraction, text preprocessing, vocabulary creation, data generation, and model training with ResNet50 and LSTM layers.
Real-time deployment: Flask app enables generating captions for uploaded images.
Promising results: Achieved 77.39% accuracy on the Flickr8k dataset.
Key Features:

Model Architecture:
Pre-trained ResNet50 for image feature extraction
LSTM layers for language processing    

Technical Stack:

Flask for deployment

TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

OpenCV for image processing

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srbhshinde/flickr8k-sau

Getting Started:


Clone the repository.

Install required dependencies (listed in requirements.txt).
Download the Flick8k dataset and place it in the data folder.
Follow instructions in the README.md files for specific project components (model training, deployment).


Future Work:

Thorough evaluation on a separate test set.
Hyperparameter tuning and exploration of advanced architectures.
Training on larger and more diverse datasets.
Implementing beam search and interactive interface.
Adapting the model to specific domains and integrating with object detection.
